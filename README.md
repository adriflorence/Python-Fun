# TASK 1 - Linked List

Implement a linked list class. The class should be able to:

- Append data to the tail of the list and prepend to the head
- Search the linked list for a value and return the node
- Remove a node
- Pop, which means to return the first node's value and delete the node from the list
- Insert data at some position in the list
- Return the size (length) of the linked list

# TASK 2 - Max-Sum-Subarray

You have been given an array containg numbers. Find and return the largest sum in a contiguous subarray within the input array.

**Example:**
* `arr= [1, 2, 3, -4, 6]`
* The largest sum is `8`, which is the sum of all elements of the array.

# TASK 3 - Pascal's Triangle

Find and return the nth row of Pascal's triangle in the form a list. n is 0-based.
**Exmaple:**
if n = 4, then output = [1, 4, 6, 4, 1].

# TASK 4 - 

# TASK 8 - Binary Tree Traversals
Implement depth-first tree traversal with recursion for all three types:
- pre-order
- in-order
- post-order

# TASK 9 - Breadth-first search
Implement breadth-first search on a tree

# TASK 10 - String Key Hash Table

In this quiz, you'll write your own hash table and hash function that uses string keys. Your table will store strings in buckets by their first two letters, according to the formula below:

`Hash Value = (ASCII Value of First Letter * 100) + ASCII Value of Second Letter`

You can assume that the string will have at least two letters, and the first two characters are uppercase letters (ASCII values from 65 to 90). You can use the Python function ord() to get the ASCII value of a letter, and chr() to get the letter associated with an ASCII value.


# TASK 11 - Pair-Sum-to-target

Given an `input_list` and a target, return the indices of pair of integers in the list that sum to the target. The best solution takes O(n) time. You can assume that the list does not have any duplicates.
