# Binary Tree Traversals

### TASK 0
Implement depth-first tree traversal with recursion for all three types:
- pre-order
- in-order
- post-order

### TASK 1
Implement breadth-first search on a tree

### TASK 10 - String Key Hash Table

In this quiz, you'll write your own hash table and hash function that uses string keys. Your table will store strings in buckets by their first two letters, according to the formula below:

`Hash Value = (ASCII Value of First Letter * 100) + ASCII Value of Second Letter`

You can assume that the string will have at least two letters, and the first two characters are uppercase letters (ASCII values from 65 to 90). You can use the Python function ord() to get the ASCII value of a letter, and chr() to get the letter associated with an ASCII value.
